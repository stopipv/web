# About 
Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) is a pervasive societal problem, affecting
roughly one third of all women and one quarter of all men. It can ruin lives 
and, in an unsettlingly high fraction of cases, culminate in murder of the
victim. Although digital technologies play an increasingly pivotal role in IPV
and directly affect victim safety and well-being, there has been very little
research that examines the use of technology in IPV and investigates the
development of new tools, techniques, and theories to combat technology-enabled
IPV, and we currently face a surfeit of important open questions. The goal of
our work is to pursue a foundational, multi-disciplinary research agenda to
better equip victims of IPV, and advocates working on their behalf, to navigate
the complex socio-technical challenges encountered in IPV contexts.
