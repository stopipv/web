#### How to View iOS App Purchase History (including hidden purchases)

To unhide hidden iOS app purchases made with your Apple ID, you will need to use the [desktop iTunes application](https://www.apple.com/itunes/download/) available on either macOS or Windows. 


Launch the iTunes application and login to your account using the same Apple ID you use on your iOS devices. 

Then, under the "Account" tab, click "View My Account". 

Now on your account information page, navigate to "iTunes in the Cloud" and click "Manage" on your hidden purchases. Once on the hidden purchases screen, click "Apps" on the upper right of the screen to see hidden apps. There you will see all hidden app purchases made with your Apple ID. To learn the purchase date of any of these apps, click "Unhide" on the relevant app(s). Then, to the view the purchase dates on your desktop, click "Back to Account". Scroll down to "Purchase History" and click "See All". On the Purchase History Page, click "Last 90 Days" and change the date range to the current year. Select "All" on the "range" dropdown menu.

 If the hidden app does not appear within the year, or any other date ranges available, the only way to see all dates after unhiding it on your macOS or Windows desktop is to do the following on your iOS device with the same Apple ID: open the App Store app. Tap on the "today" tab on the bottom left. Tap on the Apple ID profile icon on the top right of the screen. Tap on "Purchased", then "My Purchases".


 The full history of Apple App store purchase dates should appear, including those apps that you un-hid using iTunes on a desktop. You can tap "Not on this device" to see purchases made on other iOS devices using your Apple ID.

An iOS app is typically installed at the time of purchase, although it is only possible on iOS devices to infer an app's installation date by looking at its purchase date. Please let us know if we can assist in this procedure; we understand that it is not simple or intuitive. **If you do not have access to macOS or Windows**, it is still possible to learn the names of hidden app purchases on an iOS device (but **not** the purchase date) by following these instructions under the "Redownload hidden iOS apps" section: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201322.
