            Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) is a pervasive societal problem, affecting
            roughly one third of all women and one quarter of all men. It can ruin lives, 
            and, in an unsettlingly high fraction of cases, culminate in murder of the
            victim. Although digital technologies play an increasingly pivotal role in IPV
            and directly affect victim safety and well-being, there has been very little
            research that examines the use of technology in IPV and investigates the
            development of new tools, techniques, and theories to combat technology-enabled
            IPV, and we currently face a surfeit of important open questions. The goal of
            our work is to pursue a foundational, multi-disciplinary research agenda to
            better equip victims of IPV, and advocates working on their behalf, to navigate
            the complex socio-technical challenges encountered in IPV contexts.
